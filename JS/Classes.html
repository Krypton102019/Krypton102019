    //`Classes` are same as `Object`
    //Difference is we cannot describe Classes in Console
    //We have to change `Classes` into `OBject`.TO Change ,we have to write that let sth = ```new``` object's name
    //Then we can describe `Classes` in the same way of `Obj`

//=====================================================================================


    //Constructor

   class car{
constructor(carname,version){
this.name =  carname //this.name is just like name in class myself
this.version = version
console.log(`This is constructor`)
}
//prototype method
//Just like a function in Constructor Class
get showage (){let currentyear = 2021
return `This car is ${currentyear - this.version} years old`}
}


// Just Like other Classes 
// Difference is >>>>>>> let Car = new car(`ford`,2016),We have to write the parameters(`ford,2016`) that we want.
// let Car = new car(`ford`,2016)
//Differnce between normal one and this one is >>>> We can change datas.
//in Normal ones,we set the data permenantly .....like name = `YewinMyat`
